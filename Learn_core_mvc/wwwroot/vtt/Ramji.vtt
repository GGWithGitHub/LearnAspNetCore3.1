00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's say you want
 
2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For this one we will draw one line

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For the two we will leave a little bit of space and will draw two lines
 
4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For the other numbers we will draw the lines to the other direction
 
5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now we will group together different lines and will count the dots
 
6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here we have six different dots
 
7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In the middle, we have 5 different dots
 
8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And on the other side we have one dot
